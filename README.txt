#  SharpClaw -- Semi-discrete High order Accurate Package for Conservation LAWs

  Written by David Ketcheson based on the CLAWPACK software of R.J. LeVeque.

  Description:
  ------------
     SharpClaw is a library of Fortran routines designed to solve
     hyperbolic systems of PDEs with arbitrarily high order accuracy. 
     The numerical method used to solve these equations is 
     described in a paper at
     http://www.amath.washington.edu/~ketch/home/CV_files/ketch_hyp2006.pdf
